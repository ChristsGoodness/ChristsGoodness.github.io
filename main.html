<p>In the spring of 1844, the Council of Fifty was organized. Its purpose was to begin the establishment of the kingdom of God as prophesied by Daniel in Daniel 2:6-7 of the Old Covenants. This was meant to accomplish something outside of the church or congregation of Christ. As explained in the council of fifty minutes,</p>

<p class="italic-quote">
“There is a distinction between the Church of God and kingdom of God. The laws of the kingdom are not designed to affect our salvation hereafter. It is an entire, distinct and separate government.” (Council of Fifty Minutes, pp. 201-202)
</p>

<p>Soon after the organization of the Council of Fifty, a sub committee was organized to draft a constitution of the kingdom of God:</p>

<p class="italic-quote">
“The brethren spoke very warmly on the subject … of forming a constitution which shall be according to the mind of God and erect it between the heavens and the earth where all nations might flow unto it. This was considered as a “standard” to the people an ensign to the nations &amp;c.” (Council of Fifty Minutes p. 25)
</p>

<p class="italic-quote">
“On Monday the 11th, it was Resolved to draft a constitution which should be perfect, and embrace those principles which the constitution of the United States lacked, and on motion John Taylor Willard Richards, Wm W. Phelps and Parley P. Pratt were appointed a committee to draft a constitution and present it to this council for their approval or disaproval.” (Council of Fifty Minutes p. 39)
</p>

<p>That draft began, but was never completed. On April 11, 1844 Joseph Smith was anointed as a king; and 14 days later on April 25, the Lord halted all work on the constitution with a revelation that stated:</p>

<p class="italic-quote">
“Verily thus saith the Lord, yea are my constitution, and I am your God, and ye are my spokesmen. From henceforth do as I shall command you. Saith the Lord.” (Council of Fifty Minutes p. 216)
</p>

<p>As Denver Snuffer explained in his blog post All or Nothing Part 4,</p>

<p class="italic-quote">
“Apparently, once Joseph Smith was made their king, there was nothing further God could clarify for that group about the “kingdom of God.”<br><br>
“Perhaps the April 11th coronation was a mistake, and the April 25th revelation recognized there was nothing further that could be done in developing the “kingdom of God” among people who chose Joseph, instead of the God of Heaven, as their “king.””(Denver Snuffer, All or Nothing Part 4, Nov. 2, 2016)
</p>

<p>I have felt a desire to again begin on a constitution of the Kingdom of God. I wish to go forward with this endeavor together with all others – Covenant Christian or otherwise – who feel likewise inspired. In coming together to seek out the mind and will of God, great things might be revealed. In addition, by laboring together, our sharper edges will rub together, making us more smooth. After the work is done, the draft created will be humbly presented to the Lord as an offering of our best efforts and an attempt to create a unified vision as one people. Whether He accepts it as His constitution or not is not as relevant in my mind as the process we engage in together, which I can only see as bringing much good. If it is accepted, wonderful! And if not, wonderful as well because of the experience! </p>

<p>In my mind, this is a most beautiful opportunity! It allows us to learn and God to do His work however He sees fit: if He wishes to accomplish something with this constitution, He may; or if He only wishes for us to learn together through experience and then to discard the constitution after it is drafted, He may. Either way, in my mind, it will be beautiful!</p>

<p>Although the Council of Fifty was more expansive in its endeavors than just the constitution, the endeavor I’m proposing for the moment focuses only on creating a draft constitution and presenting it to the Lord. I am not proposing anything further.</p>

<p><strong>Zoom Meeting:</strong><br>
On Saturday March 14th, at 7pm MST, I’ll be hosting a Zoom meeting with the purpose of developing a plan for how to proceed with the writing of a constitution. Everyone - Covenant Christian or otherwise -is welcome to participate. I think the more people who are involved, the more beautiful the labor will be.<br><br>
